- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
This README.md is about me, normally, I won't do this, but I was forced to do so, but as soon as I finished with the github student pack registration, I may get rid of this, or I may forget to do so.  Just have fun reading about me: My name is written above, I am quite stubborn but in a good manner, this stubborness helps me alot in this coding field cos there are times I should have given up about something but my stubborness pushed me far beyond my limit, so in a nutshell, I am not a regular programmer, I am a lazy one, but productive, I bet you: if you have me in your team or organization just know you are very lucky cos my type is rare: do i really know how to code to distinguish me from regular programmer? No I am just a newbie though I have been in this field since 2019 but I was learning on my own then, I have achieved numerous things with the little knowledge I have, but let's go back to what makes me not a regular programmer ( what really distinguish me from other programmer): It lies on my ability beyond coding, It's more of a special ability which is not only useful in the coding or programming field but generally. Firstly, I am always ready to learn new thing, so I never stop learning even when I think I've really known something, Secondly, I always want to know why something is like this not how to do that thing, let's assume we are given a project and same time we are given a powerful library to work with, I always want to know why, what the library does, how the library works, why is it important, if i continue with my ability you will be lost in reading about me but let me just give you one more thing about me: I am a good observant, I've detected numerous loopholes in some website before anybody can even notice (some are intentionally while some are accidentally).

if you think this "about me" is too childish or too unserious, so be it, I am glad to tell you that the Intellectual capability of a man lies not in a README.md file, I can always build up a serious and attractive README.md file with an AI but I like to present to people what type of person I truly am.

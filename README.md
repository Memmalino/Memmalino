ðŸŒ± I am a backend software engineer and a  full stack web developer, I just graduated from ALX-Africa and I am still expanding my knowledge in coding and development. 

I am respectful to everyone because I am well-trained. I show respect to everyone regardless of their status and age. I can be stubborn, but in a constructive way. This stubbornness has helped me a lot in the coding and development field, pushing me beyond my limits when I could have easily given up. So, in a nutshell, I am not a regular programmer; I am a lazy yet productive one. If you have me in your team or organization, consider yourself lucky because my kind is rare.

Do I know evverything to distinguish myself from other programmers? No. I am still  new in this field, even though I have been learning on my own since 2019. Despite my limited knowledge, I have achieved numerous things. What sets me apart is my ability beyond coding. itâ€™s a special ability that is useful not only in programming but in life in general.

Firstly, I am always eager to learn new things, never stopping even when I think Iâ€™ve mastered something. Secondly, I strive to understand why things work the way they do, not just how to do them. If weâ€™re given a project and some tools or  libraries to work with, I want to know why we use them and the importance they serve, how they work, and what they do.

Lastly, I am a keen observer. I have detected few loopholes and bugs in s some popular websites before anyone else noticed, sometimes intentionally and sometimes accidentally.


I am also  funny,  after all, "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."

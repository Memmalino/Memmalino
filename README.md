- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
This repository is about me, normally, I won't do this, but I was forced to do so, but as soon as I finished with the stuff, I may get rid of this, Just have fun reading about me:y My name is written above, I am quite stubborn but in a good manner, this stubborness helps me alot in this coding field cos there are times I should have given up about something but my stubborness pushed me far beyond my limit, so in a nutshell, I am not a regular programmer, I am a lazy one, but productive, I bet you: if you have me in your team or organization just know you are very lucky cos my type is rare: do i really know how to code to distinguish me from regular programmer? No I am just a newbie though I have been in this field since 2019 but I was learning on my own then, I have achieved numerous things with the little knowledge I have, but let's go back to what makes me not a regular programmer ( what really distinguish me from other programmer): It lies on my ability beyond coding, It's more of a special ability which is not only useful in the coding or programming field but generally. Firstly, I am always ready to learn new thing, so I never stop learning even when I think I've really known something, Secondly, I always want to know why something is like this not how to do that thing, let's assume we are given a project and same time we are given a powerful library to work with, I always want to know why, what the library does, how the library works, why is it important, if i continue with my ability you will be lost in reading about me but let me just give you one more thing about me: I am a good observant, I've detected numerous loopholes in some website before anybody can even notice (some are intentionally while some are accidentally).
